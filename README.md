## Installation and Setup Instructions

Please installation and setup instructions about.

## Reflection

This intend of this project was to provide demographic population trends by county.  This was a Turing School of Software and Design individual project for the completion of Module Three.

I set out to build a fully functional application the would display population trends by age for the last 25years based on data available from the US Census Bureau.

The challenge of this project was merging the Ember and D3 highly opinionated javascript platforms together.  I learned a tremendous amount about the power and the complications of merging these two tools.
